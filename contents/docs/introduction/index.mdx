Residents is a robust, TypeScript-based backend API designed to serve as a solid foundation for building user-centric applications. 
Built out of the need for a reusable, secure, and feature-rich starting point, this project focuses on providing essential user management, authentication, and authorization functionalities. 
With an emphasis on developer experience, code quality, and best practices, Residents aims to streamline the development process for various applications requiring user accounts and access control.

The strengths of this project lie in its comprehensive user management system, flexible authentication options (including social logins), and a well-structured codebase with high type coverage. Built on modern technologies like Express, PostgreSQL, and Drizzle ORM, Residents prioritizes security, scalability, and ease of extension. Whether you're building a small project or laying the groundwork for a larger application, Residents provides the essential backend infrastructure to get you started quickly and securely.
