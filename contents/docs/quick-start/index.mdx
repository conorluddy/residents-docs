## Git Clone

Clone the repo to your preferred location with 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:conorluddy/Residents.git
```

cd into the directory

```bash
cd residents
```

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```


There are a few basic requirements you'll need to get this up and running.


## Git Template

Pre-configured project structures that can be easily cloned and customized. Not much different from cloning. Once you copy the template to your own repository just follow the same instructions as the git clone, but from your repo.


## NPM install
A full Express app as a module. Drop Residents into an existing Express app to add user and auth routes.


## NPX CLI tool
Coming soon - we'll have some `create residents app` commands so you can customise your setup.
