This section provides a guide on how to install and set up our project on your local machine or server.

## Getting Started Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the Residents app on your local machine:

<Step>
<StepItem title="Clone the Repository">

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/conorluddy/Residents

  cd Residents
  ```

</StepItem><StepItem title="Install Dependencies">

  ```
  npm install
  ```

</StepItem><StepItem title="Set Up Environment Variables">


- Copy the example environment file:

  ```
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

- Open the `.env` file and update the variables with your own values, especially:
  - Database connection details (POSTGRES)
  - JWT secret (JWT_TOKEN_SECRET)
  - Google OAuth credentials (if using Google login)
  - SendGrid API key (if using email functionality to send invites/reset/magic emails)

</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Set Up the Database">


- Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running
- Create a new database matching the POSTGRES_DB in your .env file
- Initialize the database schema:
  ```
  npm run push
  ```
</StepItem><StepItem title="Optional: Seed the Database">

To populate the database with sample data:
```
npm run seed
```

To create an initial admin user. This will use the values defined in your .env to set the user details, including the password, of the first user.
```
npm run seed:owner
```


</StepItem><StepItem title="Start the Development Server">

  ```
  npm run dev  
  ```

</StepItem><StepItem title="Access the API">

- The API should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your .env file)
- Swagger API documentation is available at `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`
- Swagger/OpenAPI as JSON is available at `http://localhost:3000/api-json`
</StepItem><StepItem title="Running Tests">

    ```
    npm test
    ```

</StepItem><StepItem title="Using Docker (Optional)">

If you prefer to use Docker:
- Ensure Docker is installed on your system
- Run:
  ```
  docker-compose up
  ```
This will start both the PostgreSQL database and the application in containers.

</StepItem>
</Step>

## Additional Notes

- For Google authentication, ensure you've set up a Google Developer account and obtained the necessary credentials.
- For email functionality (password resets, etc.), make sure you've set up a SendGrid account and verified your sender email.
- The application uses various environment variables for configuration. Refer to the `.env.example` file for all required variables.
- TypeScript is used for development. The `npm run build` command compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any database connection issues, double-check your PostgreSQL settings and ensure the service is running.
- For any dependency-related errors, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again.
- Ensure all required environment variables are properly set in your `.env` file.
